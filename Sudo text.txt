SUDO For JS-Powered-Password-Generator

When 'Generate Password' box is clicked promt opens asking to select length of password
when okay is clicked number is recorded and it promt then asks If I would like lowercase charaters, 
I will present a yes and no button and asnwer will be recorded, do this for other varaints.
after all prompts are answered one last prompt will say 'Generate Password' with the button Generate
If no prompt is are selected, new promt will appear saying atleast one much be slected
the button will read okay and take you back to lowercase prompt.
once once all prompts are noted a password will be randomly generated and output to id = "password"
